# SMGoLaD
Sid Meier's Game of Lords and Dragons (Please don't sue me)



This is a final project for the AP Computer Science class I am taking at Wayland High School


I plan to make a fully-functioning map generator with climates and geological features. After that, I hope to 
build a functioning gui that tracks resourcesa nd allows territories and cities on the map.



Any questions, concerns, etc contact me at johnbroderick1234@live.com with the subject "Github SMGoLaD"


This project uses the following libraries: Slick2d, lwjgl, jinput, and lwjgl_util

Progress:

- land generation
- rudimentary climate system
- Many geographic features (some modify climate)
- Incomplete resource generation
- Save system which accepts names (doesn't support resources yet)
- Load system which displays 8 saves (doesn't support resources yet)
- Main menu with music and fade on close
- land is generated with the "r" button
